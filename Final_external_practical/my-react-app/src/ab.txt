1. What is @Autowired?

@Autowired is a Spring annotation used for Dependency Injection (DI).
Spring automatically finds, creates, and injects the required object into your class.

🔥 Purpose

To automatically create and inject the required bean (object).

Removes need to manually write:

Service service = new Service();


Makes code cleaner and loosely coupled.

✅ Example of @Autowired
Service Class
@Service
public class StudentService {

    public String getStudentName() {
        return "Sukhjinder Singh";
    }
}

Controller Class
@RestController
public class StudentController {

    @Autowired   // Spring injects StudentService object automatically
    private StudentService studentService;

    @GetMapping("/name")
    public String getName() {
        return studentService.getStudentName();
    }
}

✔️ What happens?

Spring creates an object of StudentService

Injects it inside StudentController

You can use it without creating a new object

✅ 2. What is @RequestBody?

@RequestBody tells Spring Boot:
👉 "Take the JSON sent from the client and convert it into a Java object."

Used mainly in POST, PUT, PATCH operations.

🔥 Purpose

To read JSON data coming in API request body.

Automatically convert JSON → Java Object.

✅ Example of @RequestBody
Model Class
public class Student {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    // getters and setters
}

Controller with @RequestBody
@RestController
public class StudentController {

    @PostMapping("/addStudent")
    public String addStudent(@RequestBody Student student) {

        return "Student Added: " + student.getName() + ", Age: " + student.getAge();
    }
}

✔️ JSON sent by Client (Postman / React)
{
  "name": "Sukhjinder",
  "age": 22
}

✔️ What happens?

JSON → Converted to Student object

You can access it as:

student.getName();
student.getAge();

🧾 Summary (Very Simple)
Annotation	Purpose	Example Use
@Autowired	Inject dependent objects automatically (Dependency Injection)	Injecting Service into Controller
@RequestBody	Read JSON from API request body and convert to Java object	POST / PUT requests sending JSON
